Chapter 3: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – Pashtun Honor and Hospitality (Focus: Peshawar)
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is defined by Pashtunwali code—honor, revenge, and melmastia (hospitality). Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar echoes ancient storytelling.
Highlights: Attan dance (circular group dance), Pashtun dresses (shalwar kameez with waistcoat and pakol cap), and traditions like Jirga (tribal council for disputes).
History and Origin: Pashtun tribal roots, Silk Road influences from Afghanistan and Central Asia.
Cultural Importance: Strong emphasis on guest hospitality (even enemies protected); community decisions via Jirga foster justice and unity.
