Chapter 1: Punjab – Vibrant and Hospitable Traditions (Focus: Lahore)
Punjab, the "Land of Five Rivers," is known for its lively and colorful culture, rooted in agriculture and Mughal history. Lahore, the cultural capital, buzzes with bazaars, music, and festivals.
Key aspects include Bhangra dance (energetic folk dance with dhol drums), traditional Punjabi dresses (colorful shalwar kameez with phulkari embroidery for women, kurta with turban for men), and festivals like Basant (kite flying, now limited) and Vaisakhi (harvest celebration).
History and Origin: Influenced by ancient Indo-Aryan settlers, Sikh heritage, and Mughal patronage of arts.
Cultural Importance: Emphasizes joy, family gatherings, and Sufi poetry (e.g., Bulleh Shah); hospitality is legendary, with communal meals during melas (fairs).
